# Diamond-Edit
The goal of this project is to create a simple, customizable, mouseless command-line text editor (with ease of writing code primarily in mind).
Based on Vim but designed to be simpler and more compact.

## Features
Still in development, so will be lacking a lot of these features for now.

* Custom syntax highlighting for different file types
* Split window view and multiple tabs
* Easy to open many files and navigate between them (workspace management)

It will also obviously have:
* Undo history
* Search and replace
